Introduction
-------------
Nukkit is nuclear-powered server software for Minecraft: Pocket Edtion.
It has a few key advantages over PocketMine-MP:

* Written in Java, Nukkit is faster and more stable.
* Having a similar structure with PocketMine-MP, because of this it's easy to contribute to Nukkit's development. And it is also easy to rewrite PocketMine-MP plugins into Nukkit plugins.

However, Nukkit is **not finished** yet. We welcome contributions.
